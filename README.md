# Explosion Laser Datapack
A Minecraft datapack that creates a laser that explodes where it is aimed. 

It is a little experiment I did with datapacks using [Minecraft Script](https://github.com/Stevertus/mcscript). The goal/inspiration was these short movie scenes ([yt video (next 4s)](https://youtu.be/quj8sK3Phh8?t=15) | [gif](https://gfycat.com/shockedscentedleafwing))

## Usage
1. Rename a stick as "Explosion Laser"
2. Hold it
